h2. Install

Using "Bower":http://bower.io:

bc. $ bower install amata

h2. Build

Amata.js uses "Grunt":http://gruntjs.com to run tasks. First make sure that you have all base dependencies installed by running npm in the repository's directory:

bc. $ cd amata
$ npm install

After you have installed all dependencies, you will be able to run tasks using Grunt, like building and testing:

bc. $ grunt [task]

Where the @[task]@ is one of @watch@, @test@, @build@ or @release[:patch | :minor | :major]@.
